# op
"op" is a small tool that will allow you to open language or framework documentation in your browser from your terminal.

### Overview
It is not life changing, but it will help you save a few seconds here and there. Instead of leaving your terminal  or 
ide you can simply type `op <language|framework>` for a specific set of documentation, or you can type `op mdn <term>` 
to open up MDN docs with your query completed.

### Installation
This part is a work in progress that will hopefully become simpler over time.

### From source
If you write or use GoLang on your machine you can quite simply clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/damiensedgwick/op`

Change in to the project directory and run `go install` - You *should* now be able to open a terminal anywhere you like
and run `op <language|framework>` or `op mdn <term>`
